# Making Natto in an Luvele yogurt maker

## Recipe

### Soy bean aquisition

Traditionally smaller soybeans are preferred, so that the bacteria can get all the way to the center of the bean easier. It's not super easy to find beans that are as small as some of the commercially made natto packs you find in stores, so I just started out with full-sized beans. I purchase 25lbs dried beans from a wholesaler in Iowa, and the beans seem fine.

### Spore aquisition
I grabbed the Yuzo Takahashi Laboratory Co. Nattomoto. I've attempted to re-culture off an existing batch and it didn't work out. 

### Prepping the beans

#### Wash
Wash them well. Wholesale beans come pretty dirty. I have a glass jar that I use for rinsing (and soaking) the beans in so that I can see if I've actually gotten them clean. Sometimes there's deritus in with the beans that needs to be picked out. Soy is naturally full of saponins, so you can expect some foaminess as you agitate the beans.

#### Portioning
I started at 1/4 cup dried beans portions as I was struggling to get things to work well. I've upped it to 1/2 cup and that seems to be working as well.

#### Soak

I soak in the same jar that I use for rinsing the beans. Soak time is variable, and has an impact on final flavor. Soak for at up to 12 hours for a mild taste, leave for 24-36 for a gnarlier cheesier flavor. The longer soaked beans will start to form bubbles up at the top and the water will get murky, these beans will be pretty smelly as they grow up. The shorter soak produces a slight smell, but is mostly contained.

#### Cook

Steaming is probably preferred but I don't have a steamer so I boil them. I'll boil for ~6 hours currently but I want to see if I can lessen that time. The trick to boiling the beans is that you need to keep all the sugars that boil out of them or your natto won't take hold well. Boil the water down so that the beans are poking above the water. Don't burn the beans. If you've done a long soak, they'll have the cheesey smell while you boil, if you've done the short soak they'll be starchy

#### Sterilize equipment

I use the jar that came with the Luvele, and also some leftover misc glass that was laying around. Make sure to sterilize everything before adding the beans. Sterilize a spoon while you are at it. I just dump everything in boiling water for 10 minutes.

### Growing Up Natto

#### Add Spores
While the beans are still hot or warm, fill up the little spoon in the nattomoto package & dump those spores right in the pot. I've never sterilized this spoon, but haven't had problems, just don't touch the end of it. I like to shake the pot up to make sure the spores get distributed.

#### Portion out the beans

Dump those beans out into your sterilized glass containers. Make sure any liquid is evenly distributed - this is why I like to use a spoon specifically. I've read that beans shouldn't be more than 3 layers high, but haven't experimented here. Don't put a lid on!

#### Incubate

Leave the lids off the jars, place them in the incubator, place the covering on & set to 104F for 20 hours. You can do more than 24 hours, but I'd reccomend checking on it frequently and stopping at the first hint of ammonia smell. Don't take the cover off to look - you want to keep all the humidity in so the beans don't dry out. When finished gently tilt the lid so the condensation drips off to the side, place the lid on but don't make it air tight. You can eat now, but it won't be stringy. Put in the fridge for 24 hours at least, after which you should be able to place a sterile utensile in and stir to see how stringy/foamy it is. You can let it age another couple days but so far I haven't managed to not eat a batch within 2 days.

### About the Luvele

Make sure to clean out the water in your Luvele while not in use, otherwise you're prone to getting algae & other stuff growing in it and the water will smell. I haven't neded to sterlize it yet.

It's pretty expensive for what you get - I'm sure there are cheaper appliances out there. It also can only make maybe 1/2-2/3 cup of dry beans at a time, so if you want to make big batches I'd look for something cheaper.

### Eating Natto
I enjoy it plain, but it's good with a little bit of soy sauce too. I can't do raw onions, but it's often suggested to chop up some green onions to go with it.

If the texture or flavor bother you, I've substituted in natto for tofu in miso soup, which dissolves the slime and tempers the flavor a bit. Definitely do not do the long soak if you don't like the flavor.

### Nutrition
I use Natto to get my daily intake of potassium and iron. I've been struggling with my iron levels & between the natto and using a cast iron for other food I've been feeling a lot better.

### Plasic
I started learning to make natto in part because I didn't like all the plastic waste associated with it. I eat natto almost every day now, and don't have to toss anything in the trash.

### Other beans

#### Black (non-soy) Beans
no.
