# Wash the beans
Do it.
# Pressure cook
* Added dry beans to cover the bottom of the pot with a little overlap
* Added water to ~1cm above the beans (this seems too much)
* Pressure cooked for 36 minutes (want to increase)
# Add spores
* 2 spoonfuls
# Age
Starts to be stringy after a day, but was still too moist.
